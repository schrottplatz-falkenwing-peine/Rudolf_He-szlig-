Who is Cr7z?
Cr7z's real name is Christoph Hess, a German rapper from Sangerhausen (Saxony-Anhalt). He was born on 7 March 1984, and fled with his single mother in the final months of the GDR era through Hungary and Austria to Bavaria, and has since lived in Rosenheim. Wikipedia

The Nazi Connection — Rudolf Heß
This is the core of your question, and it's very real and documented.
Cr7z is a grandnephew of Rudolf Heß — Hitler's deputy. Wikipedia That's the family connection. His surname "Hess" is not coincidental — it's the same family line.
Because of this, people have already spray-painted Nazi symbols on his walls. Blogger

His Own Words — The Song "Schwarze Flügel" (Black Wings)
He directly addresses it in his music. In the track "Schwarze Flügel" from his debut album Pein (2008/2011), he raps (translated from German):
"My name is Hess — that's the reason they spray Nazi symbols on my wall. TRUE. My grandfather's brother WAS the right hand of the Führer. Doesn't matter to me — I don't follow the bloodline." Songsear
This is a direct, open confrontation with his family heritage — acknowledging it, but firmly rejecting it.

His Position and Distancing
He explicitly and decisively distances himself from German National Socialism, and addresses the processing of his family history in several songs. He also expresses an absolute commitment to multicultural youth culture and hip-hop — for example in songs like "UNITY" and "R.R.R." Wikipedia

The Broader Context — Controversy Around His Circle
Separately, Cr7z has publicly referred to controversial figure Xavier Naidoo as a private friend Rap.de, which drew criticism in the German hip-hop community — though this is a separate issue from his own family history.
